# Dymo Kanban Labels

Use a Dymo Labelwriter 450 to print your sprint.

A scrummaster might spend a long time writing out neat cards for the Scrum board. This will be a way of harvesting a sprint's-worth of issues from JIRA and printing them all off onto labels.

You can stick the labels where you like. I like dry-wipeable magnetic plastic sheet.
